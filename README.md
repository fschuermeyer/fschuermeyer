# Willkommen! Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I am Felix SchÃ¼rmeyer and currently 23 years old. I started early to find my way around the Internet and to work with it, in short: to use it for my own purposes. At the age of six I already worked on a computer for the first time, but probably rather played. At the age of eight I put my first website online. Together with a free webspace and Microsoft FrontPage I created my first page. So I was able to learn the basics of creating a website at an early age and knew what I had to do.

Also writing HTML was a lot of fun for me in the beginning. Along the way, rather earlier than programming, photography came along. At first with disposable cameras, before I got my first digital camera when I started school.

I started photography and working on the computer at a very early age and have kept it up until today. Because photography was much more important to me for a while than working with computers, I decided to take a specialized baccalaureate in design, which I haven't regretted to this day. It gave me some orientation. But because it wasn't enough for me to just design and take pictures, I also wanted to do more programming.

So I decided to train as a digital media designer, with the company's strong focus on websites. Had I arrived where I wanted to go: Programming and designing. I successfully completed the training in January 2020.

I love my world of code!
